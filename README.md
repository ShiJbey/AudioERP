# Audio ERP for Virtual Interactions

This Unity project contains testing environments for doing my
ERP study on the use of auditory stimuli to elicit P300 responses.

## To-Do
* Add the Lamp, the pen, and the calculator to the ERP menu
* Test the spacing when sitting stationary within a chair
* Move the furniture
* Replace the photo on webpage


## Warnings:
* When developing or testing on a non VR capable computer, 
  ignore errors related to 'XR' or 'OpenVR'. Scenes that do
  not contain VR specific assets should still be able to run
  without error.
