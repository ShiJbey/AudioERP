Thank you for participating.

We are collecting data to see if we can make an interface
by which VR users such as yourself, could make selections
in the virtual environment by focusing on associated sounds.

In this experiment you will hear a series of beeps. Much like
a dial tone in a phone. Each beep is associated with one of
the three objects presented infront of you and will be presented
from the left, right, or both headphones. You will be asked
to focus on a beep direction and count the number of times that
you hear a beep from that direction.

You will repeat this process 45 times, and at the end of each
of beeps you will be asked to take at least a 5-second break before
continuing on.

When all blocks are finished, you will see a screen that says "Done".
If you have any questions dont heasistate to ask and we can stop the
test at anytime if you dont wish to continue.
